        <h2>Sarah</h2>
        <p class="story-text">        
Sarah stood before the towering facade of the decrepit mansion, its once-grand architecture now consumed by decay. Ivy snaked its way up the cracked walls, casting eerie shadows in the fading light of dusk. A chill wind whispered through the overgrown garden, carrying with it a sense of foreboding that sent shivers down Sarah's spine.
<br/>
Clutching the tattered remnants of her wedding dress, Sarah hesitated before crossing the threshold into the abandoned house. She had sought refuge here, far from the prying eyes and whispered gossip of the townsfolk. But as she stepped inside, she couldn't shake the feeling that she had traded one prison for another.
<br/>
The interior was a maze of cobweb-covered corridors and dilapidated rooms, each one filled with the ghosts of a bygone era. Dust motes danced in the fading light, casting eerie shapes upon the cracked floorboards. Sarah's footsteps echoed through the empty halls, the sound of her own breath the only comfort in the oppressive silence.
<br/>
She had hoped that the solitude of the mansion would offer respite from the memories that haunted her, but instead, they seemed to grow stronger within its walls. The ghost of her failed marriage lingered in every corner, a constant reminder of the love she had lost.
<br/>
As night fell, Sarah retreated to the grand ballroom at the heart of the mansion, its once-glamorous chandeliers now reduced to twisted metal and shattered glass. She lit a solitary candle, its flickering flame casting long shadows upon the decaying walls.
<br/>
Alone in the darkness, Sarah felt a presence stirring within the mansion, a malevolent force that seemed to seep from the very walls themselves. She could hear whispered voices echoing through the halls, their words indistinct but filled with malice.
<br/>
Terrified, Sarah retreated to the safety of her room, the weight of the mansion pressing down upon her like a suffocating blanket. She curled up on the tattered remains of the bed, the fabric of her wedding dress offering little comfort against the chill that permeated the air.
<br/>
As she drifted into a fitful sleep, Sarah couldn't shake the feeling that she was not alone in the mansion, that something lurked in the shadows, watching and waiting.
<br/>
Little did she know, her solitude would soon be shattered by the arrival of an unexpected visitor, and the horrors that awaited them both in the depths of the forest beyond.
